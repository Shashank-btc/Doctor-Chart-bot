# My New React UI Application

This is a new Next.js starter project focused on building a React-based UI.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

This project uses:
- Next.js (as the React framework)
- React
- ShadCN UI components
- Tailwind CSS

It has been set up to be UI-only, with no backend or API routes pre-configured.
